# PWA Icons Required

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add the following icon files to the `/public` folder:

## Required Icons

1. **icon-16x16.png** - 16x16 pixels
2. **icon-32x32.png** - 32x32 pixels  
3. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
4. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Icon Creation

You can create these icons using:
- Online tools like [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
- Design software like Figma, Photoshop, or GIMP
- AI image generators

## Icon Design

The icons should represent your beauty shop brand. Consider using:
- Your shop logo
- Beauty-related symbols (lipstick, powder, etc.)
- Your shop name initials
- Brand colors

## Placement

Place all icon files in the `/public` folder of your project. The paths are already configured in:
- `public/manifest.json`
- `public/sw.js`

## Testing

After adding the icons:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open browser dev tools
3. Go to Application tab
4. Check Manifest and Service Worker sections
5. Test PWA installation on mobile device
